# Healthcare Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Diabetes Health Indicators dataset from Kaggle to explore health indicators related to diabetes. The aim is to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can assist healthcare professionals in understanding and mitigating diabetes risks.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various health indicators for individuals, such as:
- Diabetes status
- Blood pressure and cholesterol levels
- Smoking habits
- BMI and physical activity levels

### Key Columns
- **Diabetes_binary**: Indicates whether an individual has diabetes (1: Yes, 0: No).
- **HighBP**: Presence of high blood pressure (1: Yes, 0: No).
- **HighChol**: Presence of high cholesterol (1: Yes, 0: No).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index.
- **HeartDiseaseorAttack**: History of heart disease or heart attack (1: Yes, 0: No).

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.

## Highlights
### Data Preparation
- Cleaning missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Generating new features as needed.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Age Group Analysis**:
   - Explored diabetes prevalence by age.
2. **Lifestyle Correlations**:
   - Investigated the relationship between physical activity, diet, and diabetes.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - Used bar plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots for trend analysis.

## Insights
- Older age groups are at higher risk for diabetes.
- Sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary habits correlate strongly with diabetes.
- High blood pressure and cholesterol levels are common comorbidities.

## Future Directions
- Implement machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Combine with other datasets for comprehensive health studies.
- Investigate time-series trends with longitudinal data.

## Repository
The full analysis, including code and visualizations, is documented in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.
